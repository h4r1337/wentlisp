# Wentlisp
> My very first lisp lang
---

A project started to learn `C` by building my own lisp language with [buildyourownlisp tutorial](https://buildyourownlisp.com)

### Status:

- Chapter -> 4
- built an interactive prompt (REPL) with line edit support.
- added preprocessor for windows support.
